There are four C files and a header file related to variadic functions. The first file, `0-sum_them_all.c`, contains a function that returns the sum of all its parameters. The second file, `1-print_numbers.c`, contains a function that prints numbers followed by a new line. The third file, `2-print_strings.c`, contains a function that prints strings followed by a new line. The fourth file, `3-print_all.c`, contains a function that can print any type of data. Finally, the header file `variadic_functions.h` contains all the function prototypes for these files.
