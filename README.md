The concept of "C functions_nested_loops" appears to be related to using nested loops within C programming functions. In C, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task, and loops are used to execute a set of instructions repeatedly. When these two concepts are combined, you get "nested loops" within functions.
Nested loops in C refer to the practice of placing one loop (like a `for` or `while` loop) inside another loop. This technique is often used to perform repetitive tasks or iterate through multi-dimensional data structures like arrays or matrices.
