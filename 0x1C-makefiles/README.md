This project delves into the world of Makefiles, which are essential tools for streamlining the compilation process of code. We explore what `make` and Makefiles are, their significance, and how to use them effectively. Key concepts such as rules, variables, and common Makefile practices are covered in-depth.

The project consists of several tasks:

1. **Task 0 to Task 4**: Creating and enhancing Makefiles progressively, starting from basic setups to more comprehensive ones. Each task builds upon the previous one, adding new features and refining the Makefile structure.

2. **Task 5**: Implementing a Python function to calculate the perimeter of an island based on a given grid. This task is a technical interview preparation exercise that reinforces algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.

3. **Task 6**: Developing an advanced Makefile with additional features and restrictions. This task challenges the understanding of Makefile syntax and best practices, ensuring a thorough grasp of the topic.

Throughout the project, attention to detail and adherence to coding standards are emphasized, including proper documentation, file conventions, and adherence to specific requirements such as editor choice, operating system, and compiler versions. Overall, completing these tasks provides valuable hands-on experience in creating and managing Makefiles effectively, enhancing proficiency in software development workflows.
