**Using Command Line Arguments in Your Program**: In C and C++ programs, you can access command line arguments passed to your program by defining the `main` function with two parameters: `int argc` (representing the number of arguments) and `char *argv[]` (an array of argument strings). You can then use these arguments to customize the behavior of your program based on user input or configuration options.

**Prototypes of `main` Function**: In C and C++, the `main` function can have two common prototypes. The first, `int main()`, is used when your program doesn't require any command line arguments. The second, `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`, is used when your program needs to receive and process command line arguments. The choice depends on whether your program requires input from the command line.

**Compiling Functions with Unused Variables or Parameters**: To avoid compiler warnings for unused variables or parameters in your functions, you can either annotate them with `__attribute__((unused))` or cast them to `(void)`. These techniques inform the compiler that the unused elements are intentional and should not trigger warnings, making your code cleaner and more readable.
