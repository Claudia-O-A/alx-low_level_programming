This repository contains a robust set of C functions for working with linked lists of integers (`listint_t`). In the core functions, you'll find operations for printing all elements, counting the number of elements, adding nodes to the beginning and end, and freeing the entire linked list. These fundamental functions provide a strong foundation for basic linked list operations. Additionally, the advanced functions offer more specialized tasks, including inserting and deleting nodes at specific positions, reversing the linked list, and handling loops when printing or freeing the list. The `lists.h` header file defines the data structure and contains all the function prototypes for seamless integration.
